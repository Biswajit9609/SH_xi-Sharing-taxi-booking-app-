# Ride-Matching System

## Overview
The Ride-Matching System is a backend service designed to optimize shared rides by grouping users based on their GPS locations and destinations. The system detects users within a 5-10 km radius, groups at least four users with similar destinations, and automatically books a shared ride. Future enhancements include real-time tracking, cost optimization, and machine-learning-based route optimization.

## Features
- Detects nearby users (5-10 km radius) using GPS location.
- Groups users based on similar destinations.
- Automates ride booking once a group is formed.
- Uses the Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations.
- Stores and manages user data efficiently.
- Backend: Flask/Django
- Database: PostgreSQL/Firebase
- Location API: Google Maps/OpenStreetMap

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL/Firebase database
- Flask/Django framework
- Google Maps API (or OpenStreetMap API)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ride-matching-system.git
   cd ride-matching-system
   
2. Create a virtual environment:
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
3. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Set up environment variables in a .env file:
   
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
   
5. Run database migrations (if using Django):
   bash
   python manage.py migrate
   
6. Start the server:
   bash
   flask run  # For Flask
   python manage.py runserver  # For Django
   

## Usage
1. Users register and share their real-time GPS location.
2. The system detects nearby users and groups them based on destination similarity.
3. When a group of four or more is formed, a shared ride is booked automatically.
4. Users receive ride details and tracking information.

## API Endpoints

## Enhancing the README with Animations
To make the README more interactive, you can add animations explaining different features.

### Suggested GIFs/Animations
1. *User Flow GIF* – Show a step-by-step animation of how users are matched.

You can create GIFs using tools like *Lottiefiles, ScreenToGif (Windows), Peek (Linux), or Giphy Capture (Mac)*.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time user tracking
- Cost optimization
- Machine learning for better ride grouping
- Integration with payment gateways
